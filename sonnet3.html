<body>Wave on blacker wave, heave a tangled mass
 Of shining seagrass back upon the beach,
And my brittle heart will fracture as a glass
 That strikes indifferent ground succumbs to breach.

And day upon black day will, reeving, pass
 Between the broken edges so to teach
This wretch upon whose spirit sins amass
 To keep his aspirations within reach.

Return whatever remnant of the man
 Whose shape was banished by the somber brine,
  And sacred justice suffer what disgrace!

  How could I look my brother in the face
And say, forsaking glory, that I ran?
 Unfathomable grief is more benign!
