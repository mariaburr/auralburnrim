    Through civilization the deep beat of blood, the accuracy and mystery of the viaduct, at what once was the far edge of Earth to the tribes of Europe. Words riverine: a language of the free. Her free favor we forgot, kept in Celtic tombs, quartzes in the East face catch sunrise, Andromeda is with sunrise, when you decipher the map in dreams, when you see the city eternally stone, the future late in coming.
Imaxina canto se retrasa o futuro. What to call this life. The memory of an arch. Every life comes from afar. Todas vi√±eron de lonxe as vidas. Poetically they are inactive. They think, but it is warm or there are flies. If they can take Hancock's warf they can take your cow or my barn. Mind come to plenum when nothing more will go. The wind mad as Cassandra. What relation could there be between feet trained to walk beside the sea with a breeze from the ancient oak grove?
to walk beside the sea with a breeze from the ancient oak grove? I can see him now. In our gatherings a reflection of the borrowed glory, everyone suffered the same turmoil. Having forced their dusty volumes to go together with an understanding of modern life, multiplied in monasteries on the threshold of his days. He had to read a considerable amount, both once and for all and in the years to come, notably anything having to do with man's eventual grandeur, whether in history or himself, or the doubt, or what is promised.
history or himself, or the doubt, or what is promised. What marks the greatest distances. My mount halts and drinks and mute the ideal rises, wanders in the woods, voice clear-pitched, clear distillate, como as bebidas brancas, branco apocalipse. If one in loss returned to natal indigence, the reader returns to nativity mute as a trout, illiterate as stones, to learn again, all over again, e aprender de novo, civilization a terrible memory extended beyond the Lethe floodplain, the sediment deposits that fertilize dead dirt, the marshy cradle sealed off by sterile soil, Ur the all-conquering appeared and soon pervasive lexical borrowing evident everywhere, a Sprachbund. After the demise of the third dynasty the lavish remains, the abode of Nanna. The king continued after his death. His journey to the underworld: entire land struck, the palace devastated, panic spread rapidly among the dwellings of the black-headed, abandoned places, cities destroyed in their entirety, people seized with panic. Evil came upon Urim. The truthworthy shepherd passed away. It made the trustworthy shepherd pass away.

No sun rose in the sky, the day full of sorrow. The mother miserable because of her son. Oh my heart! Weeping bitterly in the broad square, sweet sleep did not come,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       they passed their time in lamentation over the trustworthy shepherd snatched away. The mottled barley was inundated. The mottled barely grown on the arable lands, the life of the land, inundated. To the farmer, the fertile fields yielded little. The plains did not grow lush grass anymore:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       they grow the grass of mourning. The cattle-pen destroyed, the calves bleated bitterly. The wise shepherd does not give orders anymore. The ornament of the assembly lies sick. Hands which used to grasp cannot grasp anymore: he lies sick. The sword of Sumer, the king of the Land, was taken.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Silence descended. He who was the vigour of the Land had fallen, the Land demolished, like a cypress forest stripped. Like axes against a boxwood tree in his joyous dwelling place. A sappy cedar tree uprooted where he used to sleep. A storm embraced it like a wife her sweetheart.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       His appointed time arrived. He passed away in his prime. No more rising up. Abandoned like a broken jar. With grandeur like thick clouds. He does not anymore reach out. Alas, what is it to me? Their boat was sunk, stripped of oars, punting poles and rudder, bolt broken off.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The journey to the nether world is a desolate route. The chariots were covered over, roads thrown into disorder. Dead priests chosen by extispicy announced the king's coming, a tumult arose in the nether world. He slaughtered numberless faultless bulls and fattened sheep,

The food was bitter, the water was brackish. He offered a large bow with quiver and arrows, an artful dagger, a many-coloured leather bag for a saddle-hook, a heavenly lion-headed mace, a shield resting on the ground, a battle-axe,
