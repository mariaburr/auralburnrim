<body>a detachment
let it float in blood

though dead, exude sickening charm. Necrophilic lust overwhelms the dumb innocents, rapt, stinking cold embrace, mortuary art verboten and reviled.   Nothing can sleep ever, never ever  again.       Must thrust in frozen flesh forever
So secret taxidermy, to teach the dead to ward away predatory mourners. Terrorize the wretches, a vision of life returned, remains in a pose illuding motion,     still       to conceal  the infinite haste.                     and ever 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  again
quietude secreted outside all 
runes inscribed into the old dried skin
capture the rotten element

milkwhite afterimage sank in the dark

a pang of wrong
nestled in wilted folds
the age of sediment 
forget that ever I was 

We met black extremity of night.
