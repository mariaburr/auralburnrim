I have something to say to you  that a man in himself is beginning, seeking, achieving and concluding  whose life seemed more and more to resemble my own  the catastrophe of the falls  the entrance at the end  into a great sea                                              whoever possesses the book never can be rid of it, whether he sells or burns or buries it, the book will come back.                On a lone isle lived a man so worse than the very devil that after dead and gone to hell he was again cast forth
Say it, Teacher  say what remains in the mind  the stiff, still features of the indifferent  tyrant take thy throne  and as after the form, the shadow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             returned to that black salt beach to write in blue blood and cursed words of all evil deeds.         
which will love more?                                                               that which is
whom he forgave  even if there is no dust  when I see the lark move  I will flee                    in the distance being hanged
Do you see this woman? I entered your house;  from here one could see               that tied man  that cold blood dried 
she has wet My feet with her tears                                                                  dismembered
You gave Me no kiss                                                                                 distended stomach 
Who is this man who even forgives  to sort out the animals                                                      lurching about sick  shoulders slant and slope  a goatly man was  smelt thick foul did
in the heaven of Venus  at various vantages along the cliff  to witness  weeps and is  remembered
fui chiamat' e qui refulgo
small guttersnipe
hear talk in father's kitchen  revealing the paraclete
beauty can by any possibility be brought into doubt             ahead of the guard  magpie-like  trumpet notions  destroy the past however  upon a river of time  a delta  beyond an ocean  bordered by sky  to remember and remember again  having ended, and ended in failure  the whole of life
grace stopped not an instant sweeping over violent authority                                                                                                                                                                                                                     there is a sad peace
vigour which is grace in itself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and without seeing, without thinking, my eyes already closed. A fractured, limpid revery, doggedly precise, the ashen hue of stone.
her old age, great kindness, thought for her slaves
after the old died  it was gone  to the winds  beyond all counting  there is no end  the bird, the eagle, made himself small
my duty to destroy thee world again     to creep into the hinged egg  closed wretchedly

in the open air  gripping the air  for all remain  a proposed boulevard with outlets every mile along the river
what depends on what  all cotton, cassimeres, wall papers, felt, straw hats
verses the recumbent effigy
in whose repose grows quiet  once dissipated  I said I had no desire  so far so good, a restitution  to expose me to obloquy
the stone is alive  lively and easy  shallow  will so sacrifice  l'ami de tout le monde  a man of straw  to remonstrate
the stone knows the form the carver imparts 

the crops thick in death year bring me swifter shoot  drift  these infamies amiable a likeness
the prirory's dissolution at whose behest?  escapes my forgetness now was it dust-covered
documentary evidence survives relating the shipping  where he did and when he did  retriever to the last  Have you ever thought of a hitching your stern and being ourdeaned
a veil, wimple, long gown and mantle  gun barrels, black walnut
beneath her legs are crossed       the burdensome assumption  a ditch used stuff ends down in  tell it slant  tell me your say  a dream caught out
the knight has a lion at his feet 
the lady a dog
                                                    these words I read by the firemen's torchlight procession
become badly mutilated separated from one another   on a pyramid          there is no darkness  that evil men do lives 
against the north wall of the northern outer aisle  these are lies
the woman at the feet of the man 
the present joined hands          and whether it was noon at night  still dumbfounded   inconsiderate lack of foresight
faces blurred, stiffened pleat,
that faint hint hardly meant has come to be
in stone fidelity  One and Only it must have been  after picket fences, stonewalls, out and ins
what will survive  was the word alive  on behalf of an oldest  who after the first compliments med darkist day light  Why have these puerile blonds those large flexible ears?

six hundred years      last despair  after leaning over the balcony  her nothing eyes  I tired of nothingness  she whispering muffled anguish  renunciation of flight  but it's fine  what are you still claiming to do?
everything went wrong      what they set out to do    to abominate what one has been  keeping her self from mistakes, save that of standing stock-still 
schoolmaster sent illustrations  school of quietude  satellite formations  how the teeth have been drawn  not every man can doubt
the eye of cultured mind         we have need of illumination and strength  to act like the next man  put them all to the sword 
the live man of prison lands        reaped the evil result  pierced nature's secrets  and you yourself know no more 
moved by no inner thing 
more live than they,
devouring time

because the road had been blown off the side of the mountain
