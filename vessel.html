<body>Echo overheard
resound unending mortuary volume
ne’er cease us strain in life

release my brokenbodied wife
on shining surface, dance
fervent, thine recant

or yet remit the stain
of blood expelled 
of jealous pain

exact what price to quell
the quaking of the flesh I sell
so long, and long away
we’ll reach a final better day

where none remains to say
and life in wane
an old spent lume
a word once whispered
in the vacant tomb
