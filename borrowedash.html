the end of days     rather than lose her father met unworthy end 
for an hour                             the dream fulfilled       I long for that lovely time, alas,   all men bewail thee dead, ah, let him come again, he must not die                                                                                                                                                                                     A language of quenched fire  for all and none  how innocent they are  a populace of tyrants and lickspittles, nothing true about them, they stole the limelight
ligatures impressed upon the soft skin  couldn't find any amusement      if only it were granted to me, to be                                return with the spring, waken                                                                                                                                                                                   Nothing's in the voice. Nothing. 
of women imprisoned in the arms of men  in the prospect of feeding        transported, where'er thou wanderest                                          all the songs we used  I sang to earn my bread  I grew distant from the singing  there fell a long silence  Life gives all men everything, but most do not know it.  My voice is tired, but listen.  I was overwhelmed by the song of the man who lay dying.  In his song I could see my own labors, the slave girl who gave herself to me, the men I killed, the cold dawns upon the water, the sky and sea and land above and below and around me every day and every night. If you hear, if you can see, can read them and understand, you will find in them everything you want, you will learn to be holy in this world.

I can see two apparitions dressed in white                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            this rock only seems to rest because the ground opposes a force to it greater than the pressure it exerts.

The mightiest men have hitherto bowed with reverence before the saint.  Deep Riddle of Mysterious State.  And ere the Morn cradles the Moon.                                                                                                                                                           of happiness can be compared to the solution of a quadratic equation in which you reach a certain number 
Why did they thus bow?                                                                                       like Daedalus, on strange wings,          he completed his equation and asked us what we were waiting for, and why we weren't leaving.                       no law governing the growth, the pursuit
                                                                                                              also said to be a learned mathematician, to possess the power to cure disease,                                             a feeling of unease  which never ceases growing
The spot is completely open to the sky. The ancient flagstones lay smiling and golden-tinted in the sunlight.  to control the sea by incantation, to foretell the future, to change into any animal, to perform other awesome magic,
                                                                                                                able to traverse on or under water,
                                                                                                                 or so told wandering storytellers, in ancient-times upon the isle of the apple trees she dwelt
                                                                                                                                                                                   where still he convalesces, restless to return

The road rutted and uneven.                                                                                                                                                                                             and twenty naked girls to change his plate! Poor man, straight to bed he went,
Did they realize?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             gave each church its turn,
Into the pure dimension, immune, serene, to sky worn images, white shadows sown with oblivion                                                                                                                                                                                 memorized the miracle in vogue,
         facades of space                                                       with the shade of a lost hand                                                                                                                                                                 we were in error: that was not the man. 
         a river glow like some goddess incarnate                                                   once burnt to ashes
                                her breasts a fortress
                                guarding the gates of heaven
                                          Who is this woman?
