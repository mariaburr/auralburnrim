                                        you have leapt over
                                        men in order to come upon  nothing at all.
                                        I should be delighted

                            deceived in many things
                            reason would root out all

                                                            rather a maiden all life long 
                                              than lose her father
                                                            distinguished physician of his day
                                                                                   met his end unworthy

                                                       they could be grateful
                                                   for their freedom
                                                       the dream fulfilled         the rest he reckoned slaves
                                                                 by impalement

                                                            when rain fell he was washed by Zeus, anointed by Helios
                                                                          the moisture sweated out of him

                                                            before he can do us further harm
                                                            he must be stopped, by death
                                                            he is a man who has never yet lifted a finger
                                                            force is always beside the point
