<body>Unknown men waited
at the end of the corridor

red blood brushed out broad 
over cotton duck suspended in linseed
where the cold air would come
in underneath you could 
fall to your knees

on high grade linoleum printed with penrose 
tiling spilling out from well everywhere.
They did not smile when I leveled 
accusations in every direction

face contorting to conform to
an expression left all over the walls in wide
swaths of well schooled sturm and drang

someone who belonged to these walls would
evade eye contact by ducking behind furniture.

What a needle would slide into my arm 
and let me rush out in a pinch
and later stale coffee and orange juice 
with the freaks before blacked out windows
and young nurses asking questions I wonder
and the bulbous numskull
who sleeps in the next bed 
moaning something awful at night.
