<body>a detachment
let it float in blood

though poetry is dead, the corpse exudes a sickening charm. Necrophilic lust overwhelms the dumb innocents, rapt in stinking cold embrace, mortuary arts verboten and reviled. Nothing can sleep ever again. Life must thrust into frozen flesh forever.
So the secret taxidermy commenced, to teach the dead to ward away predatory mourning. Terrorize the poor wretches with the appearance of returned life, stand the remains in a pose illuding renewed mobility, stillness seemingly concealing infinite speed.
Though only seeming. Death is final. But the death-obsession of the not quite dead yet might be broken by shock of fright, or so we speculate. 

quietude secreted outside all 
the runes inscribed into the old dried skin
capture the rotten element

milkwhite afterimage sank in the dark

a pang of wrong
nestled in wilted folds
the age of sediment 
forget that ever I was 

We met black extremity of night.
