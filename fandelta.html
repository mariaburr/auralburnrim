<body>Old industrial buildings decay.
A place of inspiration, to do business, 
a safe residence, a beacon.
There nothing left

but banded ironstones and marine lava deposits, 
interspersed with softer, easily eroded tillites, 
mudstones and conglomerates
the outcrop forms the ridge from which the basin and its rocks derive

gold was embedded in a conglomerate, 
assumed to be alluvial gold in an old riverbed
tilted by earth movements

not merely developed 
for the narrow width of a river, 
but continued in depth, 
there came the realisation that 
this conglomeratic zone was 
of sedimentary succession.

Gold occurs only 
along northern and western 
margins of this basin, 
but no continuous band.

Archean rivers 
from north and west 
formed fan deltas,
(gold bearing fan deltas now below the surface)
many braided channels, before 
flowing south to sea

rapid and frequent variation
separated by temporary islands

once a given system crosses a threshold
it will convert from meandering to braided

a lagoon located on the river-coast interface
wide, shallow channels, preventing the helical flow
all contain young, rapidly eroding mountains
