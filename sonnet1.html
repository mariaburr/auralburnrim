<body>Though once above the boundless seemed to hover,
 Iâ€™d only wreckage when it did depart:
A cleft disguised by insubstantial cover
 To supersede my extirpated part.

That once an autopsy would pray discover
 What conjoined vessels had to cleave apart,
And leave the buried pieces to recover
 Without assistance of some nobler art

To guide so delicate a hand in finding
 Edges where the lovers once were bound,
Imbue in remnants blessed anew a binding
 If only matching contours could be found.

What evidence could ever now inspire
The mending of the wound that I desire?
