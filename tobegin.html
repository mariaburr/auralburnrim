<body>As I approach, the goal recedes.
 I fall behind my origin,
Forsake desire to quell my needs,
 And pray the Lord absolves my sin.
From toil and sweat to yet be freed
 I dream, then wake to my chagrin.

Yet deep within my soul a seed
 Is sown that, grown, will feed my kin
When I am gone, and done's the deed
 I lived and died but to begin.
